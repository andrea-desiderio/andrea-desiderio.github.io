### CPSC 120

Lab 2
Though this lab is simple and straightforward, I really liked it because it was the first lab that applied fundamental programming concepts including variable declaration, evaluating user input, and output formatting because mastering std::cin and std::cout is a skill that is used throughout the semester. These principles are essential for new programmers, like me, to fully understand because they are the basis for creating future projects. Also, this labâ€™s approach to execute brief and specific tasks replicates the problem-solving strategies required to complete more difficult labs. 

Lab 4, part 1 
This lab shows the importance of flexible programming by having separate functions for unit conversions, which makes debugging easier while creating a reusable and structured program. By presenting mathematical calculations and function calls, both of which are critical abilities that are used in future labs, it builds on knowledge about user input and output. What I liked about this lab is that it was the first one that we applied our understanding of functions and how they rely on one another, allowing us to use smaller and simpler measures to build more complex solutions. 

Lab 11, part 1 
This lab integrates the concepts we learned in computer science such as: handling files, data processing, object-oriented programming, and algorithms. I liked this lab and its usage of std::stringstream because it emphasizes the significance of working with data streams to extract information from files. This lab demonstrates how basic ideas like loops and functions can be developed into more complicated tasks such as class structure by reading a CSV file, analyzing its contents, and saving the data in an object-oriented structure.
